*SFIS (School for the Future of Innovation in Society) 
**Tarot deck for Anticipatory Governance of Emerging Technologies

This ASU Oracle brings prophecies inspired by the original Tarot cards to provoke us to rethink the 
implications of various emerging technologies and understand the value of anticipatory governance. 
The algorithmic responses of this STS Pythia offer rich, at times funny and surprising socio-technical 
scenarios, through which we can express the public expectations, but also fears and imagination 
about the future. The SFIS Tarot can serve as a tool for a solemn meditation, but also as a forecasting 
tool for brainstorming, public deliberation, scenario development or even as engagement exercise.
